        <p class="paragraph-6">
          The formal solution helped the company do the basic day to day trade
          but was not fully flexible as customers (resellers) have to go through
          series of product to find what they are interested in, The brands also
          were not able to see which of the products that are performing well to
          focus more on, brands could not manage it&#x27;s resellers list, and
          not to manually approve invoices over the phone.

          <p class="paragraph-18">
            I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the
            users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group
            identified through research was working and schooling adults who
            don’t have time to go for cloth shopping. This user group confirmed
            initial assumptions about Tilo Tailor customers, but research also
            revealed that time was not the only factor limiting users from going
            for cloth shopping. Other user problems included choices, or
            challenges that make it difficult to get materials to sew or visit a
            tailor in-person. This research was to figure out the following:<br /><br />-
            To make it flexible for brands to approve invoices,           
            <br />- Brands want to be able to see which products are performing
            best, <br />- Brands want to manage its reseller base,      <br />-
            Resellers should be able to see products within their industry.<br /><br />Roles,
            responsibilities, and privileges of different categories of users
            and Information to help during the wireframes, low-fi, and user
            stories development.<br /><br />The research phase equipped us
            properly with the necessary information needed to produce
            wireframes, low-fi mockups to get feedback very early in the design
            phase. The insights, interviews, and solutions are included in this
            study.

              During the research stage, we were able to get the categories of
              users on the application. Their roles and privileges were also
              identified. This helped us profile the users appropriately based
              on their assigned duties.

              Resellers can now see brands that are in same industry as against
              seeing all brands. This saves time when searching for products to
              order.

              Overall, I am excited to work on a project that’ll help users
              complete their tasks efficiently and also help businesses improve
              the way they do business with ease. Engaging stakeholders at the
              beginning of every design phase is immensely important. User
              testing and feedback can help designers make informed decisions on
              various design propositions
