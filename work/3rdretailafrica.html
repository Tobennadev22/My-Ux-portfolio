        <p class="paragraph-6">
          The formal solution helped the company do the basic day to day trade
          but was not fully flexible as customers (resellers) have to go through
          series of product to find what they are interested in, The brands also
          were not able to see which of the products that are performing well to
          focus more on, brands could not manage it&#x27;s resellers list, and
          not to manually approve invoices over the phone.

          <h4 class="heading-7">Research</h4>
          <p class="paragraph-18">
            We conducted a research on the existing application and got
            feedbacks on pain points users experienced. With these, we were able
            to identify the problem and tailor down solutions. The redesigned
            application was tested cross users, adopting the unmoderated
            usability study approach. This was done with the prototyped high
            fidelity of the application and feedbacks were accessed to
            understand the themes and patterns across these users grouping them
            with the help of an affinity diagram after which we iterated. This
            research was to figure out the following:<br /><br />- To make it
            flexible for brands to approve invoices,            <br />- Brands
            want to be able to see which products are performing best, <br />-
            Brands want to manage its reseller base,      <br />- Resellers
            should be able to see products within their industry.<br /><br />Roles,
            responsibilities, and privileges of different categories of users
            and Information to help during the wireframes, low-fi, and user
            stories development.<br /><br />The research phase equipped us
            properly with the necessary information needed to produce
            wireframes, low-fi mockups to get feedback very early in the design
            phase. The insights, interviews, and solutions are included in this
            study.

              During the research stage, we were able to get the categories of
              users on the application. Their roles and privileges were also
              identified. This helped us profile the users appropriately based
              on their assigned duties.
